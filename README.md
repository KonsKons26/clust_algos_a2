# Second Assignment for the 'Clustering Algorithms' Course

This was a group assignment for two member teams. The instructions for the assignment are in [this file]('2nd-homework.pdf') and our report is [this file](report.pdf).

The following functions were provided by the instructor of the course:
- cost_comput.m
- distan.m
- distant_init.m
- k_means.m
- k_medians.m
- k_medoids.m
- possibi.m

The following auxiliary functions were developed by us:
- calc_eta.m
- possibi_cost.m

We developed the following scripts to perform all the analyses shown in the report:
- data_overview.m
- exploratory.m
- clusters.m
- characterization.m
